# Pre-trained Models

You can use this folder to collect the models pre-trained on NonNews-BBC and RadioNews-BBC, in the way described in the original paper. The predict function takes as input a results.txt file that is automatically generated during training and keeps track of the configuration for that model and the model checkpoint, which will output by the training function as best_model inside the relative checkpoint folder.
